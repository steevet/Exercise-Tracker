Check node version
npx create-react-app 'Name' to ceate the react project
Enter that folder then create a 'Backend' folder
Inside the backend forlder create a package.json file ' npm init -y  '
Now want to install some dependencies 'npm install express cors mongoose dotenv'
Express: is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.
Cors: cross origin resource sharing, is a mechanism that allows a web page to access restricted resources from a server on a domain different than the domain that served the web page. 
Mongoose: Mongoose is a JavaScript object-oriented programming library that creates a connection between MongoDB and the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment.
Dotenv: Loads envirement variables from a .env file into process.env, this makes developement simpler.
Then, do 'npm install -g nodemon'. nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. 
This will cause an ERROR because if a global install 
Whenenver we weant to install somethoing globally we have to use Sudo 'sudo install -g nodemon'. This will ask for ur password.
Then create server.js file in backend
Once done, run 'nodemon server' in the terminal. We would then see that out server is runnign on port 4000

Create a folder inside backend called 'models'
